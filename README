Sample configuration:
---------------------

config/database.yml

development:
  adapter: neo4j_rest
  host: localhost
  port: 7474

Check connection:
-----------------
$ rails c
Loading development environment (Rails 3.0.9)
irb(main):001:0> c = ActiveRecord::Base.connection
irb(main):002:0> c.neo_server.list_node_indexes
=> {"model_index"=>{"type"=>"exact", "template"=>"http://localhost:7474/db/data/index/node/model_index/{key}/{value}", "provider"=>"lucene"}}

For applications using multiple databases:
------------------------------------------

config/database.yml

development:
  adapter: mysql2
  host: localhost
  user: mysql
  password: mysql

graph_development:
  adapter: neo4j_rest
  host: localhost
  port: 7474

Some regular model:

class AdapterTest < ActiveRecord::Base

...

end

Model using neo4j_rest adapter (add establish_connection to corresponding entry in database.yml):

class AdapterTest < ActiveRecord::Base
  establish_connection "graph_#{Rails.env}"

  ...

end

In case the primary connection is non-neo4j_rest, migrations need to be modified a bit.

Sample migration:

class CreateAdapterTests < ActiveRecord::HybridDatabaseConnector::Migration
  connection_for AdapterTest

  def self.up
    create_table :adapter_tests do |t|
      t.timestamps
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :adapter_tests
  end
end

connection_for takes a class which could guide ActiveRecord::Migrator to use a neo4j_rest connection. In the above case, AdapterTest has an establish_connection with neo4j_rest adapter, hence "connection_for AdapterTest"
